# YTGPT
YTGPT is a Google Chrome extension that uses the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to provide users with summaries of YouTube videos. With YTGPT installed in your Chrome browser, you can easily get a summary of a video without having to watch the entire thing.

YTGPT's summarization feature is particularly useful for those who don't have the time to watch lengthy YouTube videos, but still want to know the key points and takeaways. By simply clicking the YTGPT icon while watching a video, you can quickly generate a summary that captures the essence of the video.

What sets YTGPT apart from other summarization tools is its use of GPT-3, one of the most advanced language models available today. This means that the summaries generated by YTGPT are not only accurate and informative but are also written in a natural, human-like language.

YTGPT is completely free to use and does not collect any personal or usage data. So, if you want to save time and still stay informed, give YTGPT a try and see how it can enhance your YouTube watching experience.
